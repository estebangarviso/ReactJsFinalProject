## Code Explaining

**Archtecture and Design Patterns**
This ReactJS app is implemented with Redux so it use Flux Arquitecture and Design Patterns (the same one that facebook use to build their apps). Also use Container-Layout and Style Component Design.

**Technologies**

- ReactJS, obviously, in order to create a reactive app
- Webpack as main compiler with splitted config for development and production
- Typescript for type-checking during compile time when code is been compiled to JS
- BabelJS to convert ES7+ code into a backwards compatible version of JS in current and older browsers or environments.
- Bootstrap SCSS and SCSS Theming for styling the app
- Material UI Icons

```

Run a webpack server in development mode with eval sourceMap and save bundle in public folder

```sh
yarn start

OR

npm start
